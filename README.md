# Movie Recommendation App

## About

The Movie Recommendation App is a visually captivating tool designed to enhance your movie-discovery journey. Developed during the FullyHacks Hackathon hosted by Cal State University Fullerton, this app marks my first venture into using SvelteKit. The project theme was neon, and it inspired the app's striking design and user-friendly interface. This application is not just about finding a movie to watch; it's about experiencing the joy of discovery through a neon-lit lens.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for movies by title from the home page.
- **Genre-based Discovery**: Navigate through dynamic tabs to find movies by genre, making it simple to explore films that align with your preferences.
- **Responsive Design**: Crafted with Bootstrap, the app ensures a seamless experience on devices of all sizes, complemented by a neon-inspired aesthetic.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Framework**: SvelteKit, enabling server-side rendering and client-side navigation for a smooth user experience.
- **API**: The Movie Database (TMDB) API for real-time movie data.
- **Styling**: Bootstrap for responsive design and neon-themed UI components.

## Journey and Inspiration

Embarking on this project was an incredibly fun challenge. It was my first time using SvelteKit, pushing me to explore new frontiers in web development. The neon theme was a vibrant playground that inspired the app's design, making the movie discovery process not just easy but also visually enjoyable. By leveraging the TMDB API, the app provides up-to-date movie information and a vast selection to explore. Whether you're in the mood for a timeless classic or the latest blockbuster, this app aims to guide you to your next favorite movie with style.
